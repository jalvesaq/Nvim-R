							 *Nvim-R-installation*
3. Installation~

The installation process is described in four sections:

   3.1. Installation of dependencies
   3.2. Installation of the plugin
   3.3. Troubleshooting
   3.4. Optional steps

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1. Installation of dependencies~

Before installing the plugin, you should install its dependencies:

Main dependencies:~

   Neovim >= 0.2.0 (Linux, OS X) or >= 0.2.1 (Windows):
      https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases
      See also: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim

   or Vim >= 8.1:
      http://www.vim.org/download.php
      Vim must be compiled with |+channel|, |+job| and |+conceal| features.
      In Normal mode, do `:version` to check if your Vim has these features.


   R >= 3.0.0:
      http://www.r-project.org/

   Notes about the R package `nvimcom`:

     - The R package `nvimcom` is included in Nvim-R and is automatically
       installed and updated whenever necessary. The package requires
       compilation by a C compiler (e.g. `gcc` or `clang`).

     - You do not need to load nvimcom in your .Rprofile because the Nvim-R
       plugin sets the environment variable `R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES`, including
       `nvimcom` in the list of packages to be loaded on R startup. However,
       if you set the option `defaultPackages` in a .Rprofile, you should
       include "nvimcom" among the packages to be loaded (see
       |nvimcom-not-loaded|).

     - On Windows, you have to install Rtools to be able to build the package:
       https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/


Additional dependencies for editing Rnoweb documents:~

   latexmk:       Automate the compilation of LaTeX documents.
                  See examples in |R_latexcmd|.

   PDF viewer with SyncTeX support and capable of automatically reloading
   documents. This is required only if you edit Rnoweb files.
      On Linux and other Unix systems: Zathura (recommended), Evince or Okular.
      On OS X: Skim.
      On Windows: SumatraPDF.

   wmctrl:       http://tomas.styblo.name/wmctrl/
                 Required for better SyncTeX support under X Server.
		 (Not required on either Windows or OS X)

   Python 3 and python3-pybtex library: required for omnicompletion of
   citation keys (following |R_cite_pattern|).


Additional dependencies for editing Rmd documents:~

   xdotool: Required to reload the page on the web browser (Linux only).

   Python 3 and python3-pybtex library: required for omnicompletion of
   citation keys (following the `@` symbol).


Additional suggestions for Unix (Linux, OS X, Cygwin, etc.):~

   Tmux >= 2.0:  http://tmux.sourceforge.net
		 Tmux is required only if you want to run R in an external
		 terminal emulator (see |R_in_buffer|).

   colorout:     https://github.com/jalvesaq/colorout/releases
                 Colorizes the R output in terminal emulators.
		 (Not necessary if using Neovim with |R_in_buffer| = 1)
		 You should put in your Rprofile: `library(colorout)`

You may want to improve the configuration of your |vimrc| for a better use of
the plugin. Please, see |Nvim-R-quick-setup| for some suggestions of
configuration.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2. Installation of the plugin~

Now, install Nvim-R. You have two options: Vimball and Vim Package.


Vimball~

If you want to install from the vimball, download the file Nvim-R.vmb from:

   http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2628

Then, open the file with either Vim or Neovim and do:
>
   :packadd vimball
   :so %
<
Finally, press the space bar a few time to ensure the installation of all
files.


Vim Package~

If you have a previous Vimball installation, you should uninstall it first:
>
   :packadd vimball
   :RmVimball Nvim-R
<
The Vim package is a zip file released at:

    https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R/releases

If, for instance, it was saved in the `/tmp` directory, to install it on an
Unix system, you should do for Neovim:
>
   mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/R
   cd ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/R
   unzip /tmp/Nvim-R_0.9.6.zip
<
The directory for Vim on Unix is `~/.vim/pack/R`.
For Neovim on Windows, it is `~/AppData/Local/nvim/pack/R`.
And, for Vim on Windows, it is `~/vimfiles/pack/R`.
The name of the last subdirectory does not need to be `R`; it might be
anything.

Finally, in Vim (or Neovim) run `:helptags` (adjust the path according to your
system):
>
   :helptags ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/R/start/Nvim-R/doc
<
See |packages| for details.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3. Troubleshooting (if the plugin doesn't work)~

Note: The <LocalLeader> is '\' by default.

The plugin is a |file-type| plugin. It will be active only if you are editing
a .R, .Rnw, .Rd, Rmd, or Rrst file. The menu items will not be visible and the
key bindings will not be active while editing either unnamed files or files
with name extensions other than the mentioned above (however, see
|Nvim-R-global|). If the plugin is active, pressing <LocalLeader>rf should
start R.

Did you see warning messages but they disappeared before you have had time to
read them? Type the command |:messages| in Normal mode to see them again.

If R does not start with the <LocalLeader>rf command and you get an error
message instead, you may want to set the path to the R executable (see
|R_path|).
							  *nvimcom-not-loaded*
If you see the following message in the R console:
>
   During startup - Warning messages:
   1: In library(package, lib.loc = lib.loc, character.only = TRUE,
                 logical.return = TRUE, : there is no package called ‘nvimcom’
   2: package ‘nvimcom’ in options("defaultPackages") was not found
<
Try quiting both R and Vim/Neovim and starting them again.

If you still see the message "The package nvimcom wasn't loaded yet" after
starting R, then Nvim-R could not induce R to load nvimcom. Nvim-R sets the
environment variable `R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES` before starting R. If the variable
already exists, the string ",nvimcom" is appended to it. However, if you set
the option `defaultPackages` in your .Rprofile or in a .Rprofile in the
current directory, the environment variable will be overridden. Thus, if you
have to set the option `defaultPackages`, you should include "nvimcom" among
the packages to be loaded. You might want to include "nvimcom" only if R was
started by Nvim-R, as in the example below:
>
   if(Sys.getenv("NVIMR_TMPDIR") == ""){
       options(defaultPackages = c("utils", "grDevices", "graphics", "stats", "methods"))
   } else {
       options(defaultPackages = c("utils", "grDevices", "graphics", "stats", "methods", "nvimcom"))
   }
<
Finally, run the command `:RDebugInfo` after <LocalLeader>rf and check the
path where nvimcom was installed.

On Windows, nvimcom compilation will fail if your `.Rprofile` outputs anything
during R Startup.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4. Optional steps~

Customize the plugin~

Please read the section |Nvim-R-options|. Emacs/ESS users should also read
|ft-r-indent|.


Install additional plugins~

You may be interested in installing additional general plugins to get
functionality not provided by this file type plugin, such as vim-signature.
Please read |Nvim-R-tips| for details.

Gabriel Alcaras's plugin for asynchronous R completion:
https://github.com/gaalcaras/ncm-R
It will slowdown R if its workspace has too many objects, data.frames with too
many columns or lists with too many elements (see |R_ls_env_tol|).

See https://github.com/w0rp/ale if you want a syntax checker.

If you edit Rnoweb files, you may want to try LaTeX-Box for omnicompletion of
LaTeX code (see |Nvim-R-latex-box| for details).

Note: Some of vim-latex keybindings might clash with Nvim-R ones.


==============================================================================
								  *Nvim-R-use*
4. Use~

By default, Nvim-R will run R in a built-in terminal emulator, but you can
change this behavior (see |R_in_buffer|).


4.1. Key bindings~

Note: The <LocalLeader> is '\' by default.

Note: It is recommended the use of different keys for <Leader> and
<LocalLeader> to avoid clashes between filetype plugins and general plugins
key binds. See |filetype-plugins|, |maplocalleader| and |Nvim-R-localleader|.

To use the plugin, open a .R, .Rnw, .Rd, .Rmd or .Rrst file with Vim and
type <LocalLeader>rf. Then, you will be able to use the plugin key bindings to
send commands to R.

This plugin has many key bindings, which correspond with menu entries. In the
list below, the backslash represents the <LocalLeader>. Not all menu items and
key bindings are enabled in all filetypes supported by the plugin (r, rnoweb,
rhelp, rrst, rmd).

without editing the plugin directly.

The plugin commands that send code to R Console are the most commonly used. If
the code to be sent to R has a single line it is sent directly to R Console.
If it has more than one line (a selection of lines, a block of lines between
two marks, a paragraph etc) the lines are written to a file and the plugin
sends to R the command to source the file. To send to R Console the line
currently under the cursor you should type <LocalLeader>d. If you want to see
what lines are being sourced when sending a selection of lines, you can use
either <LocalLeader>se or <LocalLeader>sa instead of <LocalLeader>ss. The
<LocalLeader>m{motion} command sends the lines from the motion command that
follows <LocalLeader>m, e.g. <LocalLeader>m} (from the current line to the end
of paragraph) or <LocalLeader>m3j (the next 3 lines including the current
line).

You can also use the command `:RSend` to type and, then, send a line of code
to R. If you use this command frequently, you may consider creating a map for
it in your |vimrc|. For example:
>
   nmap <LocalLeader>: :RSend
<
Observe that there is an empty space after `:RSend`, so you do not have to
type it.

The command <LocalLeader>o runs in the background the R command `print(line)`,
where `line` is the line under the cursor, and adds the output as commented
lines to the source code.

If the cursor is over the header of an R chunk with the `child` option (from
Rnoweb, RMarkdown or RreStructuredText document), and you use one of the
commands that send a single line of code to R, then the plugin will send to R
the command to knit the child document.

After the commands that send, sweave or knit the current buffer, Vim will
save the current buffer if it has any pending changes before performing the
tasks. After <LocalLeader>ao, Vim will run "R CMD BATCH --no-restore
--no-save" on the current file and show the resulting .Rout file in a new tab.
Please see |R_routnotab| if you prefer that the file is open in a new split
window. Note: The command <LocalLeader>ao, silently writes the current buffer
to its file if it was modified and deletes the .Rout file if it exists.

R syntax uses " <- " to assign values to variables which is inconvenient to
type. In insert mode, typing a single underscore, "_", will write " <- ",
unless you are typing inside a string. The replacement will always happen if
syntax highlighting is off (see |:syn-on| and |:syn-off|). If necessary, it is
possible to insert an actual underscore into your file by typing a second
underscore. This behavior is similar to the EMACS ESS mode some users may be
familiar with and is enabled by default. You have to change the value of
|R_assign| to disable underscore replacement.

When you press <LocalLeader>rh, the plugin shows the help for the function
under the cursor. The plugin also checks the class of the first object passed
as argument to the function to try to figure out whether the function is a
generic one and whether it is more appropriate to show a specific method. The
same procedure is followed with <LocalLeader>rp, that is, while printing an
object. For example, if you run the code below and, then, press
<LocalLeader>rh and <LocalLeader>rp over the two occurrences of `summary`, the
plugin will show different help documents and print different function methods
in each case:
>
   y <- rnorm(100)
   x <- rnorm(100)
   m <- lm(y ~ x)
   summary(x)
   summary(m)
<
Nvim-R will not check the class of the first object if the `=` operator is
present. For example, in the two cases below you would get the generic help
for `summary`:
>
   summary(object = x)
   summary(object = m)
<
To get help on an R topic, you can also type in Vim (Normal mode):
>
   :Rhelp topic
<
The command may be abbreviated to `:Rh` and you can either press <Tab> to
trigger the autocompletion of R objects names or hit CTRL-D to list the
possible completions (see |cmdline-completion| for details on the various ways
of getting command-line completion). The list of objects used for completion
is the same available for omnicompletion (see |R_start_libs|). You may close
the R documentation buffer by simply pressing `q`.

The command <LocalLeader>td will run `dput()` with the object under cursor as
argument and insert the output in a new tab. The command <LocalLeader>rv will
also run `dput()` with the object under cursor as argument and show the output
in a new tab, while <LocalLeader>vs will show it in a horizontal split, and
<LocalLeader>vv will show it in a vertical split. However, if the object under
the cursor is a data.frame or a matrix, instead of displaying the output of
`dput()`, the commands will save the data.frame or matrix in a text file with
values separated by tab characters and display this file. The command
<LocalLeader>vh will show the `head()` of the data.frame or matrix in a
horizontal split that opens above the current window. This behavior can be
customized with new mappings (see |Nvim-R-df-view-mappings| and
|Nvim-R-df-view|), and you can configure Nvim-R to call an external
application to display the data.frame or matrix. All files involved in these
operations are created in Nvim-R's temporary directory and deleted when R
quits.

When completing object names (CTRL-X CTRL-O) you have to press CTRL-N to go
forward in the list and CTRL-P to go backward (see |popupmenu-completion|). If
R is running and 'completeopt' includes the `preview` string, the preview
window will display help for the argument selected in the pop up menu (see
|R_show_arg_help|). For rnoweb, rmd and rrst file types, CTRL-X CTRL-O can
also be used to complete knitr chunk options if the cursor is inside the chunk
header.

If R is not running or if it is running but is busy the completion will be
based on information from the packages listed by |R_start_libs| (provided that
the libraries were loaded at least once during a session of Nvim-R usage).
Otherwise, the pop up menu for completion of function arguments will include
an additional line with the name of the library where the function is (if the
function name can be found in more than one library) and the function method
(if what is being shown are the arguments of a method and not of the function
itself). For both `library()` and `require()`, when completing the first
argument, the popup list shows the names of installed packages, but only if R
is running.

You can source all .R files in a directory with the Normal mode command
:RSourceDir, which accepts an optional argument (the directory to be sourced).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								     *Rinsert*
								     *Rformat*
The command  `:Rinsert` <cmd>  inserts one or more lines with the output of the
R command sent to R. By using this command we can avoid the need of copying
and pasting the output R from its console to Vim. For example, to insert
the output of `dput(levels(var))`, where `var` is a factor vector, we could do
in Vim:
>
   :Rinsert dput(levels(var))
<
The output inserted by `:Rinsert` is limited to 5012 characters.

The command `:Rformat` calls the function `tidy_source()` of formatR package
to format either the entire buffer or the selected lines. The value of the
`width.cutoff` argument is set to the buffer's 'textwidth' if it is not
outside the range 20-180. Se R help on `tidy_source` for details on how to
control the function behavior.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2. Editing Rnoweb files~

In Rnoweb files (.Rnw), when the cursor is over the `@` character, which
finishes an R chunk, the sending of all commands to R is suspended and the
shortcut to send the current line makes the cursor to jump to the next chunk.
While editing Rnoweb files, the following commands are available in Normal
mode:

   [count]<LocalLeader>gn : go to the next chunk of R code
   [count]<LocalLeader>gN : go to the previous chunk of R code

You can also press <LocalLeader>gt to go the corresponding line in the
generated .tex file (if SyncTeX is enabled).

The commands <LocalLeader>cc, ce, cd and ca send the current chunk of R code
to R Console. The command <LocalLeader>ch sends the R code from the first
chunk up to the current line.

The commands <LocalLeader>kn builds the .tex file from the Rnoweb one using
the knitr package and <LocalLeader>kp compiles the pdf; for Sweave, the
commands are, respectively <LocalLeader>sw and <LocalLeader>sp. You can jump
from the Rnoweb file to the PDF (forward search) with the command
<LocalLeader>gp. The command to jump from a specific location in the PDF to
the corresponding line in the Rnoweb (backward search) is specific to each pdf
viewer:

   Zathura: <C-LeftMouse>
   Evince:  <C-LeftMouse>
   Okular:  <S-LeftMouse>
   Skim:    <S-Cmd-Click>
   Sumatra: <Double-click>

In any case, the pdf viewer must be started by the Nvim-R plugin. See
|Nvim-R-SyncTeX| for details.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3. Omni completion and the highlighting of functions~

The plugin adds some features to the default syntax highlight of R code. One
such feature is the highlight of R functions. However, functions are
highlighted only if their libraries are loaded by R (but see
|R_start_libs|).

Note: If you have too many loaded packages Vim may be unable to load the
list of functions for syntax highlight.

Vim can automatically complete the names of R objects when CTRL-X CTRL-O is
pressed in insert mode (see |omni-completion| for details). Omni completion
shows in a pop up menu the name of the object, its class and its environment
(most frequently, its package name). If the object is a function, the plugin
can also show the function arguments in a separate preview window (this
feature is disabled by default: see |R_show_args|).

If a data.frame is found, while building the list of objects, the columns in
the data.frame are added to the list. When you try to use omni completion to
complete the name of a data.frame, the columns are not shown. But when the
data.frame name is already complete, and you have inserted the '$' symbol,
omni completion will show the column names.

Only the names of objects in .GlobalEnv and in loaded libraries are completed.
If R is not running, only objects of libraries listed in |R_start_libs| will
have their names completed. When you load a new library in R, only the current
buffer has the highlighting of function names immediately updated. If you have
other buffers open, they will be updated when you enter them.

Vim uses one file to store the names of .GlobalEnv objects and a list of
files for all other objects. The .GlobalEnv list is stored in the
`$NVIMR_TMPDIR` directory and is deleted when you quit Vim. The other files
are stored in the `$NVIMR_COMPLDIR` directory and remain available until you
manually delete them.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4. The Object Browser~

You have to use <LocalLeader>ro to either open or close the Object Browser.
The Object Browser has two views: .GlobalEnv and Libraries. If you press
<Enter> on the first line of the Object Browser it will toggle the view
between the objects in .GlobalEnv and the currently loaded libraries.

In the .GlobalEnv view, if an object has the attribute "label", it will also
be displayed. For instance, the code below would make the Object Browser
display the variable labels of an imported SPSS dataset:
>
   library(foreign)
   d <- read.spss("/path/to/spss/dataset.sav", to.data.frame = TRUE)
   vlabs <- attr(d, "variable.labels")
   for(n in names(vlabs))
       attr(d[[n]], "label") <- vlabs[[n]]
<
In the Object Browser window, while in Normal mode, you can either press
<Enter> or double click (GVim only) over a data.frame or list to show/hide its
elements (not if viewing the content of loaded libraries). If you are running
R in an environment where the string UTF-8 is part of either LC_MESSAGES or
LC_ALL variables, Unicode line drawing characters will be used to draw lines
in the Object Browser. This is the case of most Linux distributions.

In the Libraries view, you can either double click or press <Enter> on a
library name to see its objects. In the Object Browser, the libraries have the
color defined by the PreProc highlighting group. The other objects have
their colors defined by the return value of some R functions. Each line in the
table below shows a highlighting group and the corresponding type of R object:

	 PreProc	libraries
	 Number		numeric
	 String		character
	 Special	factor
	 Boolean	logical
	 Type		list
	 Function	function
	 Statement	s4
	 Comment	promise (lazy load object)

One limitation of the Object Browser is that objects made available by the
command `data()` are only links to the actual objects (promises of lazily
loading the object when needed) and their real classes are not recognized in
the GlobalEnv view. The same problem happens when the `knitr` option
`cache.lazy=TRUE`. However, if you press <Enter> over the name of the object
in the Object Browser, it will be actually loaded by the command (ran in the
background):
>
   obj <- obj
<
Note: The Object Browser may slowdown R if its workspace has too many
objects, data.frames with too many columns or lists with too many elements.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.5. Commenting and uncommenting lines~

You can toggle the state of a line as either commented or uncommented by
typing <LocalLeader>xx. The string used to comment the line will be "# ", "##
" or "### ", depending on the values of R_indent_commented and
r_indent_ess_comments (see |R_rcomment_string|).

You can also add the string "# " to the beginning of a line by typing
<LocalLeader>xc and remove it with <LocalLeader>xu. In this case, you can set
the value of R_rcomment_string to control what string will be added
to the beginning of the line. Example:
>
   let R_rcomment_string = '# '
<
Finally, you can also add comments to the right of a line with the
<LocalLeader>; shortcut. By default, the comment starts at the 40th column,
which can be changed by setting the value of r_indent_comment_column, as
below:
>
   let r_indent_comment_column = 20
<
If the line is longer than 38 characters, the comment will start two columns
after the last character in the line. If you are running <LocalLeader>; over a
selection of lines, the comments will be aligned according to the longest
line.

Note: While typing comments the leader comment string is automatically added
to new lines when you reach 'textwidth' but not when you press <Enter>.
Please, read the Vim help about 'formatoptions' and |fo-table|. For example,
you can add the following line to your |vimrc| if you want the comment string
being added after <Enter>:
>
   autocmd FileType r setlocal formatoptions-=t formatoptions+=croql
<
Tip: You can use Vim substitution command `:%s/#.*//` to delete all comments
in a buffer (see |:s| and |pattern-overview|).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								  *RBuildTags*
4.6. Build a tags file to jump to function definitions~

Vim can jump to functions defined in other files if you press CTRL-] over the
name of a function, but it needs a tags file to be able to find the function
definition (see |tags-and-searches|). The command `:RBuildTags` calls the R
functions `rtags()` and `etags2ctags` to build the tags file for the R scripts
in the current directory. Please read |Nvim-R-tagsfile| to learn how to create
a tags file referencing source code located in other directories, including
the entire R source code.


==============================================================================
							   *Nvim-R-known-bugs*
5. Known bugs and workarounds~

Known bugs that will not be fixed are listed in this section. Some of them can
not be fixed because they depend on missing features in either R or Vim;
others would be very time consuming to fix without breaking anything.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1. R's source() issues~

The R's `source()` function of the base package prints an extra new line
between commands if the option echo = TRUE, and error and warning messages are
printed only after the entire code is sourced. This makes it more difficult to
find errors in the code sent to R. Details:

   https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2012-December/065352.html


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2. The menu may not reflect some of your custom key bindings~

If you have created a custom key binding for Nvim-R, the menu in
GVim will not always reflect the correct key binding if it is not the same for
Normal, Visual and Insert modes.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.3. Functions are not always correctly sent to R~

The plugin is only capable of recognizing functions defined using the `<-`
operator. Also, only current function scope is sent to R. See:

   https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R/issues/34


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.4. Wrong message that "R is busy" (Windows only)~

On Windows, when code is sent from Vim to R Console, the nvimcom library
sets the value of the internal variable `r_is_busy` to 1. The value is set
back to 0 when any code is successfully evaluated. If you send invalid code to
R, there will be no successful evaluation of code and, thus, the value of
`r_is_busy` will remain set to 1. Then, if you try to update the object
browser, see the R documentation for any function, or do other tasks that
require the hidden evaluation of code by R, the nvimcom library will refuse to
do the tasks to avoid any risk of corrupting R's memory. It will tell Vim
that "R is busy" and Vim will display this message. Everything should work
as expected again after any valid code is executed in the R Console.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.5. R must be started by Vim~

The communication between Vim and R will work only if R was started by
Vim through the <LocalLeader>rf command because the plugin was designed to
connect each Vim instance with its own R instance.

If you start R before Vim, it will not inherit from Vim the environment
variables R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES, NVIMR_TMPDIR, NVIMR_COMPLDIR, NVIMR_ID, and
NVIMR_SECRET. The first one induces R to load nvimcom; the second variable is
the path used by the R package nvimcom to save temporary files used by Nvim-R
to: perform omnicompletion, show R documentation in a Vim buffer, and update
the Object Browser. The two last ones are used by Nvim-R and by nvimcom to
know that the connections are valid. Unless you are running R in a Neovim's
built-in terminal (which is the default on Unix), if you use Vim to start R,
but then close Vim, some variables will become outdated. Additionally, Nvim-R
sets the value of its internal variable SendCmdToR from SendCmdToR_fake to the
appropriate value when R is successfully started. It is possible to set the
values of all those variables and start the TCP client-server manually, but it
is not practical to do so.

Please see the explanation on the communication between Vim and R at the end
of

   https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R/blob/master/README.md

6.1. R in Vim/Neovim buffer~

By default, R runs in a Vim/Neovim buffer created with the command |:term|,
and the <Esc> key is mapped to stop the Terminal mode and go to Normal mode.
In Terminal mode, What you type is passed directly to R while in Normal mode
Vim's navigation commands work as usual (see |motion.txt|).

If you need the <Esc> key in R, for example if you want to use `vi`, `vim` or
`nvim` within R Console, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_esc_term = 0
<
Then, you will have to press the default <C-\><C-N> to go from Terminal to
Normal mode.

Nvim-R sets the option "editor" to a function that makes the object to be
edited in a new tab when `R_esc_term` = 1 (the default value).

Neovim does not close its built-in terminal emulator when the application
running in it quits, but Nvim-R does close it for you. If you rather prefer
that the terminal remains open after R quits, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_close_term = 0
>
Neovim stops automatically scrolling the R Console if you move the cursor to
any line that is not the last one. This emulates the behavior of other
terminal emulator, but considering that (1) R only outputs something after we
send a command to it, and (2) when we send a command to R, we want to see its
output, Nvim-R will move the cursor to the last line of R Console before
sending a command to it, forcing the auto scrolling of the terminal.

If you are using Neovim < 0.4.0, Nvim-R will enter the R Console to be able to
move the cursor to its last line. This will trigger an auto command that
relies on the cursor moving to the terminal window. If you have defined such
auto command, you will may want to put the line below in your |init.vim| to
disable the auto scrolling of the terminal:
>
   let R_auto_scroll = 0
<
You may either use the package colorout (Unix only) to colorize R output or
let Neovim highlight the terminal contents as it was a .Rout file type. Two
advantages of colorout are the possibility of highlighting numbers close to
zero in a different color and the distinction between stdout and stderr. The
value of R_hl_term (0 or 1) determines whether Neovim should syntax highlight
the R output, and its default value will be set to 0 if the package colorout
is loaded. If you prefer do not rely on the auto detection of colorout, you
should set the value of R_hl_term in your |vimrc|. Example:
>
   let R_hl_term = 0
<
Right after starting R, Nvim-R will try to detect if either the value of R's
`OutDec` option is `","` or the current R script sets the `OutDec` option. If
you are using Neovim to syntax highlight R's output and it is not correctly
detecting R's `OutDec` option, then, to get numbers correctly recognized, you
should put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_OutDec = ','
<
On Unix systems, BEFORE sending a command to R Console, if the terminal width
has changed, Vim/Neovim will send to nvimcom the command `options(width=X)`,
where X is the new terminal width. You can set the value of R_setwidth to 0 to
avoid the width being set. Example:
>
   let R_setwidth = 0
<
On Windows, the command is sent to R Console because it would crash R if sent
through nvimcom.

If you have the option 'number' set in your |vimrc|, Nvim-R will calculate the
number of columns available for R as the window width - 6. If you want a
different adjustment, you should set `R_setwidth` as a negative value between
-1 and -16. Example:
>
   let R_setwidth = -7
<
You can also set the value of `R_setwidth` to `2`. In this case, nvimcom will
check the value of the environment variable `COLUMNS` AFTER each command is
executed and if the environment variable exists, R's width option will be set
accordingly. This is the most precise way of setting the option "width", but
it has the disadvantage of setting it only after the command is executed. That
is, the width will be outdated for the first command executed after a change
in the number of columns of the R Console window.

Nvim-R sets the option 'winfixwidth' in the window where R runs. This prevents
the window of being automatically resized in some circumstances. It also sets
the option 'nobuflisted'. You can set the value of `R_buffer_opts` to define
what options should be set in the R Console buffer. It is a list of Vim
options separated by spaces. Example with its default value:
>
   let R_buffer_opts = "winfixwidth nobuflisted"
<
Tips:

  - Use the commands CTRL-W H and CTRL-W K to switch the editor and the R
    console orientation (vertical and horizontal). See |window-moving| for a
    complete description of commands.

  - If you have set the option 'number' and want to disable it just for the
    built-in terminal emulator, put in your |init.vim|:
>
    autocmd TermOpen * setlocal nonumber
<
    or in your |vimrc|:
>
    autocmd TerminalOpen * setlocal nonumber
<
  - If you want to press `gz` in Normal mode to emulate the <C-a>z Tmux
    command (zoom Window), put the following in your |vimrc|:
>
    " Emulate Tmux ^az
    function ZoomWindow()
        let cpos = getpos(".")
        tabnew %
        redraw
        call cursor(cpos[1], cpos[2])
        normal! zz
    endfunction
    nmap gz :call ZoomWindow()<CR>
<
    Then, you can open the current buffer in a new tab to get it occupying the
    whole screen.

If you do not want to run R in Vim/Neovim's built in terminal emulator, you
have to install Tmux >= 2.0, and then put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_in_buffer = 0
<
Then, R will start in an external terminal emulator (useful if you use two
monitors and want Vim/Neovim and R separate from each other), and Tmux will be
used to send commands from Vim/Neovim to R.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								      *R_term*
								  *R_term_cmd*
							       *R_silent_term*
6.2. Terminal emulator (Linux/Unix only)~

Note: The options of this section are ignored on Mac OS X, where the command
`open` is called to run the default application used to run shell scripts.

If |R_in_buffer| = 0 and the X Window System is running and Tmux is installed,
then R will run in an external terminal emulator. The plugin uses the first
terminal emulator that it finds in the following list:

    1. gnome-terminal,
    2. konsole,
    3. xfce4-terminal,
    4. Eterm,
    5. (u)rxvt,
    6. aterm,
    7. roxterm,
    8. lxterminal
    9. xterm.

If Vim does not select your favorite terminal emulator, you may define it in
your |vimrc| by setting the variable R_term, as shown below:
>
   let R_term = 'xterm'
<
If your terminal emulator is not listed above, or if you are not satisfied
with the way your terminal emulator is called by the plugin, you may define in
your |vimrc| the variable R_term_cmd, as in the examples below:
>
   let R_term_cmd = 'xterm -title R -e'
   let R_term_cmd = 'tilix -a session-add-right -e'
   let R_term_cmd = 'xfce4-terminal --icon=/path/to/icons/R.png --title=R -x'
<
Please, look at the manual of your terminal emulator to know how to call it.
The last argument must be the one which precedes the command to be executed.

Note: Terminal emulators that require the command to be executed to be quoted
(such as `termit`) are not supported.

The terminal error messages, if any, are shown as warning messages, unless you
put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_silent_term = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							         *Rtools_path*
							      *R_save_win_pos*
							   *R_arrange_windows*
							      *R_set_home_env*
6.3. Windows specific options~

Nvim-R will try to find the path to Rtools installation and add it to the
beginning of the `PATH` environment variable. If it cannot find the path, or
if it takes too long to find it, you can put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let Rtools_path = "C:\\Rtools"
<
By default, Nvim-R will save the positions of R Console and Vim windows
when you quit R with the <LocalLeader>rq command, and it will restore the
positions of the windows when you start R. If you do not like this behavior,
you can put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_save_win_pos = 0
   let R_arrange_windows = 0
<
If you want R and GVim windows always in a specific arrangement, regardless of
their state when you have quited R for the last time, you should arrange them
in the way you want, quit R, change in your |vimrc| only the value of
R_save_win_pos and, finally, quit Vim.

The plugin sets `$HOME` as the Windows register value for "Personal" "Shell
Folders" which is the same value set by R. However, if you have set `$HOME`
yourself with the intention of changing the default value of `$HOME` assumed
by R, you will want to put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_set_home_env = 0
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							       *R_rnowebchunk*
							       *R_rmdchunk*
							       *R_assign_map*
							       *R_assign*
6.4. Assignment operator and Rnoweb completion of code block~

In Rnoweb files, a `<` is replaced with `<<>>=\n@`. To disable this feature,
put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_rnowebchunk = 0
<
Similarly, in Rmd files the grave accent is replaced with chunk delimiters
unless you put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_rmdchunk = 0
<
While editing R code, `_` is replaced with `<-`. If you want to bind other
keys to be replaced by `<-`, set the value of |R_assign_map| in your
|vimrc|, as in the example below which emulates RStudio behavior (may only
work on GVim):
>
   let R_assign_map = '<M-->'
<
Note: If you are using Vim in a terminal emulator, you have to put in your
|vimrc|:
>
   set <M-->=^[-
   let R_assign_map = '<M-->'
<
where `^[` is obtained by pressing CTRL-V CTRL-[ in Insert mode.

Note: You can't map <C-=>, as StatET does because in Vim only alphabetic
letters can be mapped in combination with the CTRL key.

To completely disable this feature, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_assign = 0
<
If you need to type many object names with underscores, you may want to change
the value R_assign to 2. Then, you will have to type two `_` to get
them converted into `<-`. Alternatively, if the value of R_assign is 3, the
plugin will run the following command in each buffer containing R code (R,
Rnoweb, Rhelp, Rrst, and Rmd):
>
   iabb <buffer> _ <-
<
That is, the underscore will be replaced with the assign operator only if it
is preceded by a space and followed by a non-word character.

							    *R_objbr_h*
							    *R_objbr_place*

							    *R_objbr_openlist*
							    *R_objbr_allnames*
							    *R_objbr_labelerr*
6.5. Object Browser options~

By default, the Object Browser will be created at the right of the script
window, and with 40 columns. Valid values for the Object Browser placement are
the combination of either "script" or "console" and "right", "left", "above",
"below", separated by a comma. You can also simply choose "RIGHT", "LEFT",
"TOP" or "BOTTOM" to start the Object Browser as far as possible to the
indicated direction. Examples:
>
   let R_objbr_place = 'script,right'
   let R_objbr_place = 'console,left'
   let R_objbr_place = 'LEFT'
   let R_objbr_place = 'RIGHT'
<

The minimum width of the Object Browser window is 9 columns. You can change
the object browser's default width by setting the value of |R_objbr_w| in your
|vimrc|, as below:
>
   let R_objbr_w = 30
<
If the Object Browser is being created bellow or at the top of the existing
window, it will be 10 lines high, unless you set its height in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_objbr_h = 20
<
Below is an example of setup of some other options in the |vimrc| that
control the behavior of the Object Browser:
>
   let R_objbr_opendf = 1    " Show data.frames elements
   let R_objbr_openlist = 0  " Show lists elements
   let R_objbr_allnames = 0  " Show .GlobalEnv hidden objects
   let R_objbr_labelerr = 1  " Warn if label is not a valid text
<
Objects whose names start with a "." are hidden by default. If you want them
displayed in the Object Browser, set the value of `R_objbr_allnames` to `1`.

When a `data.frame` appears in the Object Browser for the first time, its
elements are immediately displayed, but the elements of a `list` are displayed
only if it is explicitly opened. The options `R_objbr_opendf` and
`R_objbr_openlist` control the initial status (either opened or closed) of,
respectively, `data.frames` and `lists`. The options are ignored for
`data.frames` and `lists` of libraries which are always started closed.

If an object R's workspace has the attribute `"label"`, it is displayed in
Vim's Object Browser. If the `"label"` attribute is not of class
`"character"`, and if  `R_objbr_labelerr` is `1`, an error message is printed
in the Object Browser.

							      *R_open_example*
							      *R_nvimpager*
							      *R_editor_w*
							      *R_help_w*
6.6. Vim as pager for R~

6.6.1. Quick setup~

If you do not want to see R examples in a Vim buffer, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_open_example = 0
<
If you do not want to see R documentation in a Vim buffer, put in your
|vimrc|:
>
   let R_nvimpager = 'no'
<
This option can only be set to "no" in the |vimrc|. It will be automatically
changed to a suitable value if it is set to "no" after Vim startup.

If you want to see R documentation in Vim, but are not satisfied with the
way it works, please, read the subsection 6.6.2 below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.6.2. Details and other options:~

The plugin key bindings will remain active in the documentation buffer, and,
thus, you will be able to send commands to R as you do while editing an R
script. You can, for example, use <LocalLeader>rh to jump to another R help
document.

The valid values of `R_nvimpager` are:

   "tab"       : Show the help document in a new tab. If there is already a
                 tab with an R help document tab, use it.
                 This is the default if R_in_buffer = 0.
   "vertical"  : Split the window vertically if the editor width is large
                 enough; otherwise, split the window horizontally and attempt
                 to set the window height to at least 20 lines.
                 This is the default if R_in_buffer = 1.
   "horizontal": Split the window horizontally.
   "tabnew"    : Show the help document in a new tab.
   "no"        : Do not show R documentation in Vim.

The window will be considered large enough if it has more columns than
R_editor_w + R_help_w. These variables control the minimum
width of the editor window and the help window, and their default values are,
respectively, 66 and 46. Thus, if you want to have more control over Vim's
behavior while opening R's documentations, you will want to set different
values to some variables in your |vimrc|, as in the example:
>
   let R_editor_w = 80
   let R_editor_h = 60
<
Unless the value of `R_nvimpager` is "tabnew", the buffer name will always be
"R_doc" to force the reuse of the window when users jump from one help page to
another.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								      *R_path*
								      *R_app*
								      *R_cmd*
6.7. R path and application names~

Vim will run the first R executable in the path. You can set an alternative
path to R in your |vimrc| as in the examples:
>
   let R_path = '/path/to/my/preferred/R/version/bin'
   let R_path = "C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-3.3.1\\bin\\i386"
<
On Windows, Vim will try to find the R install path in the Windows Registry.

You can set the path to a different R version for specific R scripts in your
|vimrc|. Example:
>
   autocmd BufReadPre ~/old* let R_path='~/app/R-2.8.1/bin'
<
By default the value of `R_app` is `"R"` on Unix systems (such as Linux and
Mac OS X). On Windows, it is `Rterm.exe` if R is going to run in a Neovim
buffer and `"Rgui.exe"` otherwise. Nvim-R cannot send messages to `Rterm.exe`
in an external `cmd` window. If your R binary has a different name (for
example, if it is called by a custom script), you should set the value of
`R_app` in your |vimrc|.

By default the plugin will call the application `R` to run the following
commands:
>
   R CMD build nvimcom
   R CMD install nvimcom
   R CMD BATCH current_script.R
<
If it is necessary to call a different application to run the above commands
in your system, you should set the value of `R_cmd` in your |vimrc|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								      *R_args*
6.8. Arguments to R~

Set this option in your |vimrc| if you want to pass command line arguments to
R at the startup. The value of this variable must be a |List|. Example:
>
   let R_args = ['--no-save', '--quiet']
<
On Linux, there is no default value for |R_args|. On Windows, the default
value is `['--sdi']`, but you may change it to `['--mdi']` if you do not like
the SDI style of the graphical user interface.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								*R_start_libs*
6.9. Omnicompletion and syntax highlight of R functions~

The list of functions to be highlighted and the list of objects for
omnicompletion are built dynamically as the libraries are loaded by R.
However, you can set the value of R_start_libs if you want that
the functions and objects of specific packages are respectively highlighted
and available for omnicompletion even if R is not running yet. By default,
only the functions of vanilla R are always highlighted. Below is the default
value of R_start_libs:
>
   let R_start_libs = 'base,stats,graphics,grDevices,utils,methods'
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							    *Rout_more_colors*
							    *R_hi_fun_globenv*
							    *R_hi_fun_paren*
							    *R_hi_fun*
6.10. Syntax highlight: functions and .Rout files~

By default, the R commands in .Rout files are highlighted with the color of
comments, and only the output of commands has some of its elements highlighted
(numbers, strings, index of vectors, warnings and errors).

If you prefer that R commands in the R output are highlighted as they are in R
scripts, put the following in your |vimrc|:
>
   let Rout_more_colors = 1
<
When syntax highlighting .Rout files, Nvim-R considers "> " as the prompt
string and "+ " as the continuation string. If you have defined different
prompt and continuation strings in your `~./Rprofile`, you should do the same
in your |vimrc|. Example:
>
   let g:Rout_prompt_str = '» '
   let g:Rout_continue_str = '… '
<
By default, Nvim-R highlights the names of R functions even if they are not
followed by a parenthesis. If you prefer to highlight R functions only if
the `(` is typed, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_hi_fun_paren = 1
<
Note: The syntax highlighting is slower when `R_hi_fun_paren` is 1, and,
depending on your system configuration, the slowness might be noticeable.

By default, functions from `.GlobalEnv` and other environments in the
`search()` path whose names do not start with `"package:"` are not highlighted
to avoid the need of both nvimcom saving a temporary file with the list
objects in these environments after each command sent to R and Nvim-R reading
and parsing this file, which might be slow in some machines, and especially if
R's workspace has too many objects, data.frames with too many columns or lists
with too many elements. Anyway, if you prefer these functions highlighted, put
in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_hi_fun_globenv = 1
<
The functions from `.GlobalEnv` as well as functions from other environments
in the search path will be highlighted when created, but the highlighting will
not be cleared when the functions are deleted because sending commands to R
could become noticeably slow when editing files with complex syntax highlight
such as large RMarkdown scripts. Anyway, if you want the syntax highlighting
of these functions cleared and redone after each command sent to R, put in
your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_hi_fun_globenv = 2
<
Functions from environments in the search path are highlighted as functions
from packages, but in Neovim (not in Vim) you can set a different highlight
command for them in your |vimrc|, as in the example below:
>
   hi rGlobEnvFun ctermfg=117 guifg=#87d7ff cterm=italic gui=italic
<
If you prefer to completely disable the syntax highlighting of R functions put
in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_hi_fun = 0
<
On Unix systems, the highlighting of new functions created in the `.GlobalEnv`
will be interrupted if nvimcom takes more than 500 milliseconds to create the
list of objects that Nvim-R needs to find and, then, highlight new functions
(this also affects `ncm-R` completion). If you want that nvimcom be either more
or less tolerant to delays, put a different value in your |vimrc|. Valid
values are between 10 and 10000 milliseconds. Example:
>
   let R_ls_env_tol = 700
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								 *R_routnotab*
6.11. How to automatically open the .Rout file~

After the command <LocalLeader>ao, Vim will save the current buffer if it
has any pending changes, run `R CMD BATCH --no-restore --no-save` on the
current file and show the resulting .Rout file in a new tab. If you prefer
that the file is open in a new split window, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_routnotab = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							  *R_indent_commented*
						          *R_rcomment_string*
6.12. Indent commented lines~

You can type <LocalLeader>xx to comment out a line or selected lines. If the
line already starts with a comment string, it will be removed. After adding
the comment string, the line will be reindented by default. To turn off the
automatic indentation, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_indent_commented = 0
<
The string used to comment text with <LocalLeader>xc, <LocalLeader>xu,
<LocalLeader>xx and <LocalLeader>o is defined by R_rcomment_string.
Example:
>
   let R_rcomment_string = '# '
<
If the value of `r_indent_ess_comments` is 1, `R_rcomment_string` will be
overridden and the string used to comment the line will change according to
the value of `R_indent_commented` ("## " if 0 and "### " if 1; see
|ft-r-indent|).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								*R_notmuxconf*
6.13. Tmux configuration (Linux/Unix only)~


If Vim is running R in an external terminal emulator, R will run in a Tmux
session with a specially built Tmux configuration file. If you want to use
your own ~/.tmux.conf, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_notmuxconf = 1
<
If you opted for using your own configuration file, the plugin will write a
minimum configuration which will set the value of four environment variables
required for the communication with R and then source your own configuration
file (~/.tmux.conf).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							  *R_rconsole_height*
							  *R_rconsole_width*
							  *R_min_editor_width*
6.14. Control of R window~

When starting R, Neovim's buffer is split vertically if its width is larger
than:
>
   R_min_editor_width + R_rconsole_width + 1 + (&number * &numberwidth)
<
That is, if it is large enough to guarantee that both the script and the R
windows will have at least the desired number of columns even if 'number' is
set. The default value of both `R_min_editor_width` and `R_rconsole_width` is
80. If you prefer the window is always split vertically, set these two options
with lower values in your |vimrc|. Example:
>
   let R_rconsole_width = 57
   let R_min_editor_width = 18
<
You can also set a `R_rconsole_width` relative to current Vim window width.
For example, if you want to split the available horizontal space evenly
between Vim and R, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   autocmd VimResized * let R_rconsole_width = winwidth(0) / 2
<
If you always prefer a horizontal split, set the value of `R_rconsole_width`
to 0:
>
   let R_rconsole_width = 0
<
For a horizontal split, you can set the number of lines of the R window:
>
   let R_rconsole_height = 15
<
You should set 'nosplitright' if you wanted the R Console on the left side,
and 'nosplitbelow' if you wanted it above the R script.

Note: If running R in a Neovim buffer, the number of lines and columns will
automatically change if you switch between horizontal and vertical splits (see
|CTRL-W_K| and |CTRL-W_H|). You may request Neovim to try to keep the minimum
width and height of a specific window by setting the options 'winwidth' and
'winheight'. So, if the window is split horizontally and you want a small R
Console window, you should set a large value for 'winheight' in the script
window.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							       *R_applescript*
								 *RStudio_cmd*
6.15. Integration with R.app (OS X only) and RStudio~

If you are on Mac OS X and want to use the R.app graphical application, put in
your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_in_buffer = 0
   let R_applescript = 1
<
If you want to run RStudio instead of R set in your |vimrc| the value of
`RStudio_cmd` to the complete path of the RStudio_cmd binary. Example:
>
   let R_in_buffer = 0
   let RStudio_cmd = 'C:\Program Files\RStudio\bin\rstudio'
<
Note: You must manually run a successful comand in RStudio Console before
sending code from Vim to RStudio. The command might be something as simple as
the number `1`.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							       *R_listmethods*
							       *R_specialplot*
6.16. Special R functions~

The R function `args()` lists the arguments of a function, but not the
arguments of its methods. If you want that the plugin calls the function
`nvim.list.args()` after <LocalLeader>ra, you have to add to your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_listmethods = 1
<
By default, R makes a scatterplot of numeric vectors. The function
`nvim.plot()` do both a histogram and a boxplot. The function can be called by
the plugin after <LocalLeader>rg if you put the following line in your
|vimrc|:
>
   let R_specialplot = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							   *R_paragraph_begin*
							   *R_parenblock*
							   *R_bracketed_paste*
6.17. Control how paragraphs and lines are sent~

By default, when you press <LocalLeader>pp Nvim-R sends all contiguous lines to
R, that is all lines above and below the current one that are not separated by
an empty line. If you prefer that only lines from the cursor position to the
end of the paragraph are sent, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_paragraph_begin = 0
<
If a line has an opening parenthesis, all lines up to the closing parenthesis
are sent to R when you send a line of code to R. If you prefer to send the
lines one by one, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_parenblock = 0
<
Bracketed paste mode will bracket R code in special escape sequences when it
is being sent to R so that R can tell the differences between stuff that you
type directly to the console and stuff that you send. It is particularly
useful when you are using a version of R which is compiled against readline
7.0+ or when rice console is used. To enable it, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_bracketed_paste = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							       *R_source_args*
							   *R_commented_lines*
6.18. Arguments to R source() function~

When you send multiple lines of code to R (a selection of lines, a paragraph,
code between two marks or an R chunk of code), Nvim-R saves the lines in a
temporary file and, then, sends to R a command which calls `base::source()` to
run the commands from the temporary file.

By default, R's `source()` is called with the arguments `print.eval=TRUE` and
`spaced=FALSE`. The argument `local=parent.frame()` is passed to `source()`
too because it is run inside another function the. But you can either add or
change the arguments passed to it. Examples:
 >
   let R_source_args = 'echo = TRUE'
   let R_source_args = 'print.eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, spaced = TRUE'
<
If you want that commented lines are included in the code to be sourced, put
in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_commented_lines = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							      *R_sweaveargs*
							      *R_latexcmd*
							      *R_texerr*
							      *R_cite_pattern*
6.19. LaTeX options~

To produce a pdf document from the .tex file generated by either `Sweave()` or
`knit()` command, Nvim-R calls:
>
   latexmk -pdf -pdflatex="xelatex %O -file-line-error -interaction=nonstopmode -synctex=1 %S"
<
If `xelatex` is not installed, it will be replaced with `pdflatex` in the
above command. If `latexmk` is not installed, Nvim-R will call either
`xelatex` or `pdflatex` directly.

You can set the value `R_latexcmd` to change this behavior. `R_latexcmd` is a
list: its first element is the command to be executed and the remaining
elements are arguments to be passed to the command. Examples:
>
   let R_latexcmd = ['pdflatex']
   let R_latexcmd = ['xelatex']
   let R_latexcmd = ['latexmk', '-pdf', '-pdflatex="xelatex %O -synctex=1 %S"']
<
The elements of `R_latexcmd` may contain double quotes (as in the last example
above), but not single quotes, because Nvim-R will use single quotes to
separate them in an R's `c()` command.

If you want to pass arguments to the `Sweave()` function, set the value of the
R_sweaveargs variable.

If the value of `R_texerr` is `1`, nvmimcom will output to R Console LaTeX
errors and warnings produced by the compilation of the .tex document into
.pdf. So, you do not have to scroll the R Console seeking for these messages.
However, if Nvim-R cannot not find the LaTeX log file because it is not saved
in the same directory as the Rnoweb, you should set the value of
`R_latex_build_dir`. Example:
>
   let R_latex_build_dir = 'build'
<
If you are no using LaTeX-Box omni completion, you can set the value of
`R_cite_pattern` to control when completion of citation keys is activated.
Example:
>
   let R_cite_pattern = '\\\(cite\|bibentry\)\S*{'
<
You do not need to set `R_cite_pattern` if you have already set the value of
`LatexBox_cite_pattern`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							   *R_rmd_environment*
6.20. Rmd environment~

When rendering an Rmd file, the code can be evaluated (and saved) in a
specified environment.  The default value is `.GlobalEnv` which makes the
objects stored in the Rmd file available on the R console.  If you do not want
the  objects stored in the Rmd file to be available in the global environment,
you can set
>
    let R_rmd_environment = 'new.env()'
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							 *R_never_unmake_menu*
6.21. Never unmake the R menu~

Use this option if you want that the "R" menu item in GVim is not deleted when
you change from one buffer to another, for example, when going from a .R file
to a .txt one:
>
   let R_never_unmake_menu = 1
<
When this option is enabled all menu items are created regardless of the file
type.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							      *R_clear_line*
							      *R_editing_mode*
6.22. Clear R Console line before sending commands~

When one types <C-a> in the R Console the cursor goes to the beginning of the
line and when one types <C-k> the characters to the right of the cursor are
deleted. This is useful to avoid characters left on the R Console being mixed
with commands sent by Vim. Nvim-R will add <C-a><C-k> to every command if you
put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_clear_line = 1
<
Nvim-R reads your `~/.inputrc` and, if it finds the string "set editing-mode
vi" it will send to R <Esc>0Da instead of <C-a><C-k>. If Nvim-R fails to
detect that R is running in vi editing mode, you have to put this line in your
|vimrc|:
>
   let R_editing_mode = "vi"
<
This might produce a beep when sending commands, and you may want to disable
the audible bell only for R by putting in your `~/.inputrc`:
>
   $if R
       set bell-style none
   $else
       set bell-style audible
   $endif
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							   *R_pdfviewer*
							   *R_openpdf*
							   *R_openhtml*
6.23. Open PDF after processing rnoweb, rmd or rrst files~

The plugin can automatically open the pdf file generated by pdflatex, after
either `Sweave()` or `knit()`. This behavior is controlled by the variable
|R_openpdf| whose value may be 0 (do not open the pdf), 1 (open only
the first time that pdflatex is called) or a number higher than 1 (always
open the pdf). For example, if you want that the pdf application is started
automatically but do not want the terminal (or GVim) losing focus every time
that you generate the pdf, you should put in put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_openpdf = 1
<
If you use Linux or other Unix and eventually use the system console (without
the X server) you may want to put in your |vimrc|:
>
   if $DISPLAY != ""
       let R_openpdf = 1
   endif
<
The default value of `R_openpdf` is 1 on Mac OS X and 2 on other systems.

On Windows, Nvim-R will call Sumatra to open the PDF, and, on Mac OS X, it
will call Skim. On Linux, you can change the value of R_pdfviewer in your
|vimrc| to define what PDF viewer will be called. Valid values are "zathura"
(default, and the one best integrated with Nvim-R), "evince" and "okular".

If editing an Rmd file, you can produce the html result with <LocalLeader>kr
or <LocalLeader>kh (it may also work with other file types). The html file
will be automatically opened if you put the following in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_openhtml = 1
<
The meanings of different values of R_openhtml are:

   0: Never open the html.
   1: Always open the html.
   2: Decide between opening the html and reloading the page (Linux only).

The browser application called by Nvim-R is whatever is returned by the R
command `getOption("browser")`, unless it is NULL. In this case, Nvim-R will
call `open` on both Windows and Mac OS X, and `xdg-open` on Linux.

Most browser will open a new tab each time they are called instead of
refreshing a document that is already open. Please, see |Nvim-R-reload-html|
for a workaround.

If you rather prefer that Nvim-R never tries to open the web browser, put in
your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_openhtml = 0
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							      *R_rrstcompiler*
							      *R_strict_rst*
							      *R_rst2pdfpath*
							      *R_rst2pdfargs*
6.24. Support to RreStructuredText file~

By default, Nvim-R sends the command `render_rst(strict=TRUE)` to R
before using R's `knit()` function to convert an Rrst file into an rst one. If
you prefer the non strict rst code, put the following in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_strict_rst = 0
<
You can also set the value of R_rst2pdfpath (the path to rst2pdf
application), R_rrstcompiler (the compiler argument to be passed to R
function knit2pdf), and R_rst2pdfargs (further arguments to be passed
to R function knit2pdf).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							  *R_insert_mode_cmds*
6.25. Allow R commands in insert mode~

Nvim-R commands are enabled for Normal mode, but most of them can also be
enabled in Insert mode. However, depending on your <LocalLeader>, this can
make it very difficult to write R packages or Sweave files.  For example, if
<LocalLeader> is set to the `\` character, typing `\dQuote` in a .Rd file
tries to send the command!

If you want to enable commands in Insert mode, add the following to your
|vimrc|:
>
   let R_insert_mode_cmds = 1
<
See also: |Nvim-R-localleader|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								  *R_allnames*
								  *R_rmhidden*
6.26. Show/remove hidden objects~

Hidden objects are not included in the list of objects for omni completion. If
you prefer to include them, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let g:R_allnames = 1
<
Hidden objects are removed from R workspace when you do <LocalLeader>rm. If
you prefer to remove only visible objects, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let g:R_rmhidden = 0
<
After removing the objects, Nvim-R will also send CTRL-L to the R Console to
clear the screen. If you have set vi mode in your `~/.inputrc` you might also
want to set CTRL-L to clear the screen, as explained at

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/104094/is-there-any-way-to-enable-ctrll-to-clear-screen-when-set-o-vi-is-set

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								    *R_source*
6.27. Source additional scripts~

This variable should contain a comma separated list of Vim scripts to be
sourced by Nvim-R. These scripts may provide additional
functionality and/or change the behavior of Nvim-R. If you have such
scripts, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_source = '~/path/to/MyScript.vim,/path/to/AnotherScript.vim'
<
Currently, there is only one script known to extend Nvim-R features:

   Support to the devtools R package~
   https://github.com/mllg/vim-devtools-plugin


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							       *R_non_r_compl*
6.28. Completion of non R code~

Rnoweb~

The omnicompletion of bibliographic data from bib files requires Python 3 and
the PyBTeX library for Python 3.

For Rnoweb documents, omnicompletion of non R code is similar to that provided
by LaTeX-Box, but better adjusted for an Rnoweb document. The completion of
citation keys gathers data from `.bib` files in the same directory of the
current Rnoweb document, and the completion works only if a pattern similar to
"\cite{" precedes the cursor (see |R_cite_pattern|). Some of the most commonly
used LaTeX commands are also completed. The completion of the argument for
both `\ref{}` and `\pageref{}` includes both the label of R chunks where the
option `fig.cap` was found prefixed with `fig:` and the string attributed to
the argument `label` in the R code, but only if they begin with the substring
"tab:".

If the reference includes the field "file", you can open this file by typing
<LocalLeader>od in Normal mode with the cursor over the citation key.

Rmarkdown~

For RMarkdown documents it is recommended the installation of zotcite for
completing citation keys directly from Zotero database:

   https://github.com/jalvesaq/zotcite

You can also use another plugin to insert citation keys if they use the same
@zotero_key#your_citation_key scheme for building citation keys. The
citation.vim plugin does just this, providing a source for Unite:

   https://github.com/rafaqz/citation.vim

If zotcite is not installed, Nvim-R will do omni completion of bibliographic
citation keys from `.bib` files, requiring Python 3 and the PyBTeX library for
Python 3 to work. Then, Nvim-R will look for bibliographic data in any `.bib`
file listed in the `bibliography` field of the YAML header. If the
`bibliography` field is not defined, it will use all `.bib` files that are in
the same directory of the RMarkdown document as bibliography sources. The list
of `.bib` files is updated whenever the buffer is saved.

If the reference includes the field "file", you can open this file by typing
<LocalLeader>od in Normal mode with the cursor over the citation key.

If you include Python chunks in your Rmd document, you should put the lines
below in your |vimrc| to get them highlighted:
>
   let g:markdown_fenced_languages = ['r', 'python']
   let g:rmd_fenced_languages = ['r', 'python']
<
You may also want to install the jedi-vim plugin to get omni completion of
Python code when the cursor is within a Python chunk:

   https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim

Lines of Python code are sent to R Console as arguments to
`reticulate::py_run_string()`. Hence, you must send to R the command
`library(reticulate)` before sending lines of Python code.


How to disable~

To disable the completion of non R code in Rmd and Rnoweb files, and use the
omni completion provided by another plugin, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_non_r_compl = 0
<
Then, Nvim-R may use another function to complete non R code, such as the ones
from vim-pandoc or LaTeX-Box

If you want a different function for completion of non R code, you should not
set the value 'omnifunc' in your |vimrc| because you would lose the completion
of R objects. It is better to use an |autocmd| to set the value of buffer the
variable `b:rplugin_non_r_omnifunc`. Examples:
>
   autocmd FileType rnoweb let b:rplugin_non_r_omnifunc = "g:LatexBox_Complete"
   autocmd FileType rmd let b:rplugin_non_r_omnifunc = "g:omnifunc=pandoc#completion#Complete"
<
Note: On Windows, Nvim-R's bibliographic completion works only with ascii letters.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								  *R_complete*
								 *R_show_args*
							     *R_show_arg_help*
							    *R_args_in_stline*
6.29. Function arguments~

During omni completion, triggered by CTRL-X CTRL-O, a preview window shows
functions' description and usage. If you do not want the preview window,
put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_show_args = 0
<
When completing function arguments, objects from both R Workspace and loaded
libraries are included in the list, but only if there no argument to complete.
You can change this behavior in your |vimrc| as in the examples below:
>
   let R_complete = 1 " Include names of objects if there is no argument
   let R_complete = 2 " Always include names of objects
<
During the completion of function arguments, the preview window shows R's
documentation help for the item being completed unless you put in your
|vimrc|:
>
   let R_show_arg_help = 0
<
You can also completely disable the preview window by setting 'completeopt'
without the `preview` string.

If you want that function arguments are displayed in Vim's status line when
you insert `(`, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_args_in_stline = 1
<
The status line is restored when you either type `)` or leave Insert mode.
This option is useful only if the window has a status line (see 'laststatus').
If the string with the list of arguments is longer than the status line width,
the list is not displayed completely. This argument is incompatible with most
plugins that changes the status line. It is also incompatible with any plugin
that automatically closes parentheses. Functions of .GlobalEnv do not have
their arguments displayed. You can change the appearance of the status line by
setting the `R_sttline_fmt` (default value = `"%fun(%args)"`, where `%fun` is
replaced by the function name and `%args` by the list of arguments). See
'statusline' to know how to format the status line. The example below put some
colors in the status line (see |highlight-groups|):
>
   let R_sttline_fmt = '%#Function#%fun%#Delimiter#(%#Normal#%args%#Delimiter#)'
<
If you knew Vim Language, you could look at the Nvim-R source code (file
`R/common_global.vim`) and set the value of `R_set_sttline_cmd`. The example
below sets the color of individual arguments' names to the highlight group
`Special`:
>
   let R_sttline_fmt = '%#Function#%fun%#Normal#(%args)'
   let R_set_sttline_cmd = "let sline = substitute(sline, " .
           \ "'\\( \\|(\\)\\(\\w\\.*\\w*\\.*\\w*\\)\\(=*\\)\\(.\\{-}\\)\\([,)]\\)', " .
           \ "'\\1%#Special#\\2%#Normal#\\3\\4\\5', 'g')"


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								      *R_wait*
6.30. Time to wait for nvimcom loading~

Nvim-R asynchronously waits 60 seconds for the nvimcom package to be loaded
during R startup. If 60 seconds are not enough to your R startup, then set a
higher value for the variable in your |vimrc|. Example:
>
   let R_wait = 100
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								*R_wait_reply*
6.31. Time to wait for R reply~

By default Nvim-R waits 2 seconds for R to reply after a request for omni
completion is issued. You can set the amount of time Nvim-R waits (in seconds)
in your |vimrc|.  Example:
>
   let R_wait_reply = 5
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								   *R_nvim_wd*
6.32 Start R in working directory of Vim~

When you are editing an R file (.R, .Rnw, .Rd, .Rmd, .Rrst) and start R, the R
package nvimcom runs the command `setwd()` with the directory of the file
being edited as argument, that is, the R working directory becomes the same
directory of the R file. If you want R's working directory to be the same as
Vim's working directory, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_nvim_wd = 1
<
This option is useful only for those who did not enable 'autochdir'.

If you prefer that Nvim-R does not set the working directory in any way, put
in |vimrc|:
>
   let R_nvim_wd = -1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							       *R_after_start*
							     *R_after_ob_open*
6.33 Commands to be executed after either R startup or Object Browser opening~

If you want that Vim executes either Vim or external commands right after R
startup, set the value of R_after_start in your |vimrc|. The `R_after_start`
variable must be a list of strings. Strings representing Vim commands must
start with `:` and strings representing external commands must start with `!`.

For example, if you want that the R script window is hidden right after R
startup, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_after_start = [':hide']
<
Nvim-R stores the environment variable $WINDOWID of the terminal where R is
running as $RCONSOLE. Thus, if you are running R in a external terminal
emulator on Linux, `~/bin` is in your path, and you want to resize and change
the positions of the terminals containing Vim and R, you may create a
script `~/bin/after_R_start` similar to the following:
>
   #!/bin/sh
   wmctrl -i -r $RCONSOLE -e 0,0,200,1200,800
   wmctrl -i -r $WINDOWID -e 0,300,40,1200,800
   wmctrl -i -r $WINDOWID -b remove,maximized_vert,maximized_horz
<
Then, make the script executable, and put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_in_buffer = 0
   let R_after_start = ['!after_R_start']
<
Similarly, on Mac OS X, the script below (developed by songcai) will bring the
focus to Neovim terminal window:
>
   #!/usr/bin/env osascript

   --Raise the Terminal window containing name ".R".
   tell application "Terminal"
     set index of window 1 where name contains ".R" to 1
     delay 0.05
     activate window 1
   end tell

   --Click the title bar of the raised window to bring focus to it.
   tell application "System Events"
     tell process "Terminal"
       click menu item (name of window 1) of menu of menu bar item "Window" of menu bar 1
     end tell
   end tell
<
If you want that Nvim-R executes Vim commands right after the Object Browser
is open, set the value of `R_after_ob_open` as a list of commands. Example:
>
   let R_after_ob_open = [':tabnew %']
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							    *R_user_maps_only*
							    *R_disable_cmds*
6.34 Disable Nvim-R commands~

The Nvim-R sets many default key bindings.  The user can set custom
key bindings (|Nvim-R-key-bindings|).  If you wish Nvim-R to only
use those key-bindings specified by the user, put in your |vimrc|:
>
    let R_user_maps_only = 1
<
If you want to disable only some of Nvim-R commands, create a Vim list with
their key bindings names in your |vimrc|. The complete list of key bindings
names is shown at the Custom key bindings section (Nvim-R-key-bindings).
Below is an example on how to disable the commands that sends `setwd()` and
`dput()` to R Console:
>
   let R_disable_cmds = ['RSetwd', 'RDputObj']
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								  *R_tmpdir*
								  *R_compldir*
6.35 Temporary files directories~

You can change the directories where temporary files are created and
stored by setting in your |vimrc| the values of R_tmpdir and
R_compldir, as in the example below:
>
   let R_tmpdir = '/dev/shm/R_tmp_dir'
   let R_compldir = '~/.cache/Nvim-R'
<
The default paths of these directories depend on the operating system. If you
want to know what they are, while editing an R file, do in Normal mode:
>
   :echo g:rplugin.tmpdir
   :echo g:rplugin.compldir
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							      *R_remote_tmpdir*
							      *R_nvimcom_home*
6.36 Options for accessing Remote R from local Vim~

See |Nvim-R-remote|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							      *Nvim-R-df-view*
							      *R_csv_app*
							      *R_csv_delim*
6.37 View a data.frame or matrix~


You can see data.frames and matrices in external applications. You should
prefix the application name with `terminal:` if it is a terminal application
and you want to run it in Vim/Neovim's built in terminal emulator. For
example, if you want to use Visidata to see tabular data put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_csv_app = 'terminal:vd'
<
If you are running Vim/Neovim within Tmux, you may prefer:
>
   let R_csv_app = 'tmux new-window vd'
<
You may also try to see the table in a graphical viewer such as LibreOffice
Calc:
>
   let R_csv_app = 'localc'
   let R_csv_app = 'c:/Program Files (x86)/LibreOffice 4/program/scalc.exe'
<
On Windows, `R_csv_app` works only in GVim, not in Neovim.

If the default field delimiter causes problems in your case, you can change it
in your |vimrc|. Valid values are `"\t"`, `";"` and `","`. Example:
>
   let R_csv_delim = ','
<
There is also the option of configuring Nvim-R to run an R command to
display the data. Example:
>
   let R_df_viewer = "relimp::showData(%s, font = 'Courier 14')"
<
The value of R_df_viewer is a string and the substring `%s` is replaced by the
name of the object under the cursor.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							      *Nvim-R-SyncTeX*
6.38 SyncTeX support~

SyncTeX is a set of communication systems used by some PDF viewers and by some
text editors which allow users to jump from a specific line in the text editor
to the corresponding line in the PDF viewer and vice-versa. The Nvim-R
has support for the SyncTeX systems of five applications:

   Linux:   Zathura, Evince and Okular
   OS X:    Skim
   Windows: SumatraPDF

On Linux, the application `wmctrl` is required to raise both the PDF viewer
and Vim windows.

To completely disable SyncTeX support, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let R_synctex = 0
<
You do not have to do anything special in your Rnoweb document if you are
using the knitr package, and are editing single file Rnoweb documents.
Otherwise, keep reading...

If you use `Sweave()` rather than `knit()`, you must put in your Rnoweb
document:
>
   \SweaveOpts{concordance=TRUE}
<
If you work with a master document and child subdocuments, each child
subdocument (TeX and Rnoweb alike) should include the following line:
>
   % !Rnw root = master.Rnw
<
where `master.Rnw` must be replaced with the name of the actual master
document.

Note: The current knitr package (version 1.7) has at least two limitations:

   - It has no SyncTeX support for child documents. The correspondence data
     point to lines right below child chunks in the master document and not to
     somewhere in the child documents themselves. See:
     https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/225

   - It only starts registering the concordance after the first chunk. So, it
     is recommended that you put the first chunk of R code just after the
     `\begin{document}` command.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.38.1 Okular configuration~

In Okular, do the mouse clicks described below and fill the field "Command"
from "Custom Text Editor" as exemplified:
>
     Settings
     Configure Okular
     Editor
     Dropdown menu: Custom Text Editor
           Command: nclientserver '%f' %l
<
Note: If the PDF document is already open the first time that you jump to it,
and if Okular was not started with the `--unique` argument, another instance
of Okular will be started.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.38.2 Skim configuration~

In Skim, click in the drop down menu and fill the fields:
>
   Skim
   Settings
   Sync
   Preset: Custom
   Command: nclientserver
   Arguments: '%file' %line
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.38.3 Qpdfview configuration~

Qpdfview is only partially supported: SyncTeX backward does not work with file
paths containing spaces, and the qpdfview window is not automatically raised
during SyncTeX forward search. If you want to use it despite these
limitations, click in its drop down menu as illustrated below and fill the
field Source editor:
>
   Edit
   Settings
   Source editor: nclientserver %1 %2
<

==============================================================================
							 *Nvim-R-key-bindings*
7. Custom key bindings~

When creating custom key bindings for Nvim-R, it is necessary to create three
maps for most functions because the way the function is called is different in
each Vim mode. Thus, key bindings must be made for Normal mode, Insert mode,
and Visual mode.

To customize a key binding you should put in your |vimrc| something like:
>
   nmap <LocalLeader>sr <Plug>RStart
   imap <LocalLeader>sr <Plug>RStart
   vmap <LocalLeader>sr <Plug>RStart
<
The above example shows how to change key binding used to start R from
<LocalLeader>rf to <LocalLeader>sr. After changing the maps in your |vimrc|,
you have to restart Vim.

Only the custom key bindings for Normal mode are shown in Vim's menu, but
you can type |:map| to see the complete list of current mappings, and below is
the list of the names for custom key bindings (the prefix RE means "echo"; RD,
"cursor down"; RED, both "echo" and "down"):

   Star/Close R~
   RStart
   RCustomStart
   RClose
   RSaveClose

   Clear R console~

See also: |R_user_maps_only| and |R_disable_cmds|.

The completion of function arguments only happens in Insert mode.

The plugin also contains a function called RAction which allows you to build
ad-hoc commands to R. This function takes the name of an R function such as
"levels" or "table" and the word under the cursor, and passes them to R as a
command.

For example, if your cursor is sitting on top of the object called gender and
you call the RAction function, with an argument such as levels, Vim will
pass the command `levels(gender)` to R, which will show you the levels of the
object gender. To make it even easier to use this and other functions, you
could write custom key bindings in your |vimrc|, as in the examples below:
>
   nmap <silent> <LocalLeader>rk :call RAction("levels")<CR>
   nmap <silent> <LocalLeader>t :call RAction("tail")<CR>
   nmap <silent> <LocalLeader>H :call RAction("head")<CR>
   nmap <silent> <LocalLeader>h :call RAction("head", "@,48-57,_,.")<CR>
<
The second, and optional, argument that can be passed to RAction is the value
of 'iskeyword' that will be used to get the word under cursor (see the last
example above).

If you want an action over an selection, then the second argument must be the
string `"v"`:
>
   vmap <silent> <LocalLeader>h :call RAction("head", "v")<CR>
<
In this case, the beginning and the end of the selection must be in the same
line.

If either a second or a third optional argument starts with a comma, it will
be inserted as argument(s) to the RAction function. Examples:
>
   nmap <silent> <LocalLeader>h :call RAction('head', ', n = 10')<CR>
   nmap <silent> <LocalLeader>t :call RAction('tail', ', n = 10, addrownums = FALSE')<CR>
<
If the command that you want to send does not require an R object as argument,
you can create a shortcut to it by following the example:
>
   map <silent> <LocalLeader>s :call g:SendCmdToR("search()")<CR>
<

								 *Nvim-R-tips*
9. FAQ and tips~

9.1. How to start and quit R automatically?~

If you want that R is started automatically when you start editing an R
script, you should create in |vimrc| auto commands for each R file type that
you usually edit. However, you should try to start R only if it is not already
started. Examples for R and RMarkdown:
>
   autocmd FileType r if string(g:SendCmdToR) == "function('SendCmdToR_fake')" | call StartR("R") | endif
   autocmd FileType rmd if string(g:SendCmdToR) == "function('SendCmdToR_fake')" | call StartR("R") | endif
<
And if you want to quit automatically when quiting Vim, put in your |vimrc|
(replace `"nosave"` with `"save"` if you want to save R's workspace):
>
   autocmd VimLeave * if exists("g:SendCmdToR") && string(g:SendCmdToR) != "function('SendCmdToR_fake')" | call RQuit("nosave") | endif
<

9.2. Is it possible to stop R from within Vim?~

Yes. In Normal mode do `:RStop` and Vim will send SIGINT to R which is the
same signal sent when you press CTRL-C into R's Console.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.3. Html help and custom pager~

If you prefer to see help pages in an html browser, put in your `~/.Rprofile`:
>
   options(help_type = "html")
<
and in your |vimrc| (see |R_nvimpager|):
>
   let R_nvimpager = 'no'
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							    *Nvim-R-showmarks*
9.4. How do marked blocks work?~

Vim allows you to put several marks (bookmarks) in buffers (see |mark|). The
most commonly used marks are the lowercase alphabet letters. If the cursor is
between any two marks, the plugin will send the lines between them to R if you
press <LocalLeader>bb. If the cursor is above the first mark, the plugin will
send from the beginning of the file to the mark. If the cursor is below the
last mark, the plugin will send from the mark to the end of the file. The mark
above the cursor is included and the mark below is excluded from the block to
be sent to R. To create a mark, press m<letter> in Normal mode.

We recommended the use of either ShowMarks or vim-signature which show what
lines have marks defined. The plugins are available at:

   http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=152
   https://github.com/kshenoy/vim-signature

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							     *Nvim-R-snippets*
9.5. Use snipMate~

You probably will want to use the snipMate plugin to insert snippets of code
in your R script. The plugin may be downloaded from:

   http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540

The snipMate plugin does not come with snippets for R, but you can copy the
files r.snippets and rmd.snippets that ship with Nvim-R (look at the R
directory) to the snippets directory. The files have only a few snippets, but
they will help you to get started. If you usually edit rnoweb files, you may
also want to create an rnoweb.snippets by concatenating both tex.snippets and
r.snippets. If you edit R documentation, you may want to create an
rhelp.snippets


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							     *Nvim-R-bindings*
9.6. Easier key bindings for most used commands~

The most used commands from Nvim-R probably are "Send line" and "Send
selection". You may find it a good idea to map them to the space bar in your
|vimrc| (suggestion made by Iago Mosqueira):
>
   vmap <Space> <Plug>RDSendSelection
   nmap <Space> <Plug>RDSendLine
<
If you want to press <C-Enter> to send lines to R, see:

   https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R/issues/64

You may also want to remap <C-x><C-o>:

   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2269005/how-can-i-change-the-keybinding-used-to-autocomplete-in-vim

Note: Not all mappings work in all versions of Vim. Some mappings may not
work on GVim on Windows, and others may not work on Vim running in a
terminal emulator or in Linux Console. The use of <Shift>, <Alt> and <Fn> keys
in mappings are particularly problematic.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							  *Nvim-R-localleader*
9.7. Remap the <LocalLeader>~

People writing Rnoweb documents may find it better to use a comma or other key
as the <LocalLeader> instead of the default backslash (see |maplocalleader|).
For example, to change the <LocalLeader> to a comma, put at the beginning of
your |vimrc| (before any mapping command):
>
   let maplocalleader = ','
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							     *Nvim-R-tagsfile*
9.8. Use a tags file to jump to function definitions~

Vim can jump to a function definition if it finds a "tags" file with the
information about the place where the function is defined. To generate the
tags file, use the R function `rtags()`, which will build an Emacs tags file.
You can use the nvimcom function `etags2ctags()` to convert the Emacs tags
file into a Vim one. To jump to a function definition, put the cursor over
the function name and hit CTRL-]. Please, read |tagsrch.txt| for details on
how to use tags files, specially the section |tags-option|.

You could, for example, download and unpack R's source code, start R inside
the ~/.cache/Nvim-R directory and do the following commands:
>
   rtags(path = "/path/to/R/source/code", recursive = TRUE, ofile = "RTAGS")
   etags2ctags("RTAGS", "Rtags")
<
Then, you would quit R and do the following command in the terminal emulator:
>
   ctags --languages=C,Fortran,Java,Tcl -R -f RsrcTags /path/to/R/source/code
<
Finally, you would put the following in your |vimrc|, optionally inside an
|autocmd-group|:
>
   autocmd FileType r set tags+=~/.cache/Nvim-R/Rtags,~/.cache/Nvim-R/RsrcTags
   autocmd FileType rnoweb set tags+=~/.cache/Nvim-R/Rtags,~/.cache/Nvim-R/RsrcTags
<
Note: While defining the autocmd, the Rtags path must be put before RsrcTags.

Example on how to test whether your setup is ok:

   1. Type `mapply()` in an R script and save the buffer.
   2. Press CTRL-] over "mapply" (Vim should jump to "mapply.R").
   3. Locate the string "do_mapply", which is the name of a C function.
   4. Press CTRL-] over "do_mapply" (Vim sould jump to "mapply.c").


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							      *Nvim-R-folding*
9.9. Folding setup~

Vim has several methods of folding text (see |fold-methods| and
|fold-commands|). To enable the syntax method of folding for R files, put in
your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_syntax_folding = 1
<
With the above option, Vim will load R files with all folds closed. If you
prefer to start editing files with all folds open, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   set nofoldenable
<
Notes: (1) Enabling folding may slow down Vim. (2) Folding is not a file
type plugin option. It is a feature defined in syntax/r.vim.

Note: Indentation of R code is very slow because the indentation algorithm
sometimes goes backwards looking for an opening parenthesis or brace or for
the beginning of a `for`, `if` or `while` statement. This is necessary because
the indentation level of a given line depends on the indentation level of the
previous line, but the previous line is not always the line above. It's the
line where the statement immediately above started. Of course someone may
develop a better algorithm in the future.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.10. Highlight chunk header as R code~

By default, Vim will highlight chunk headers of RMarkdown and
RreStructuredText with a single color. When the code is processed by knitr,
chunk headers should contain valid R code and, thus, you may want to highlight
them as such. You can do this by putting in your |vimrc|:
>
   let rrst_syn_hl_chunk = 1
   let rmd_syn_hl_chunk = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.11. Automatically close parenthesis~

Some people want Vim automatically inserting a closing parenthesis, bracket
or brace when an open one has being typed. The page below explains how to
achieve this goal:

   http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Automatically_append_closing_characters


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.12. Automatic line breaks~

By default, while editing R code, Vim does not break lines when you are
typing if you reach the column defined by the 'textwidth' option. If you
prefer that Vim breaks the R code automatically put in your |vimrc|:
>
   autocmd FileType r setlocal formatoptions+=t
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.13. Run your Makefile from within R~

Do you have many Rnoweb files included in a master tex or Rnoweb file and use
a Makefile to build the pdf? You may consider it useful to put the following
line in your |vimrc|:
>
   nmap <LocalLeader>sm :update<CR>:call g:SendCmdToR('system("make")')<CR>
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							     *Nvim-R-Rprofile*
9.14. Edit your ~/.Rprofile~

You may want to edit your `~/.Rprofile` in addition to considering the
suggestions of |Nvim-R-R-setup| you may also want to put the following
lines in your `~/.Rprofile` if you are using Linux:
>
   grDevices::X11.options(width = 4.5, height = 4, ypos = 0,
                          xpos = 1000, pointsize = 10)
<
The `X11.options()` is used to choose the position and dimensions of the X11
graphical device. You can also install the application wmctrl and create
shortcuts in your desktop environment to the commands
>
   wmctrl -r "R Graphics" -b add,above
   wmctrl -r "R Graphics" -b remove,above
<
which will toggle the "always on top" state of the X11 device window.
Alternatively, you can right click on the X11 device window title bar and
choose "Always on top". This is useful to emulate a feature present in R IDEs
which can display R plots in a separate panel. Although we can not embed an R
graphical device in Vim, we can at least make it always visible over the
terminal emulator or the GVim window.

And add this to your `~/.Rprofile` if you want to use `w3m`, a text based web
browser, to navigate through R docs after `help.start()` when you cannot run a
graphical web browser (e.g. when you are in the Linux console):
>
   if(interactive() && Sys.info()[["sysname"]] == "Linux" && Sys.getenv("DISPLAY") == ""){
       if(Sys.getenv("TMUX") != "")
           options(browser = function(u) system(paste0("tmux new-window 'w3m ", u, "'")))
       else if(Sys.getenv("NVIMR_TMPDIR") != "")
           options(browser = function(u) .C("nvimcom_msg_to_nvim",
                                            paste0('StartTxtBrowser("w3m", "', u, '")')))
   }
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.15. Debugging R functions~

The Nvim-R-Plugin does not have debugging facilities, but you may want to use
the R package "debug":
>
   install.packages("debug")
   library(debug)
   mtrace(function_name)
<
If you receive a message about the package not being available on CRAN, you
could try:
>
   install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/debug/debug_1.3.1.tar.gz",
   repos = NULL, type = "source")

Once the library is installed and loaded, you should use
`mtrace(function_name)` to enable the debugging of a function. Then, the next
time that the function is called it will enter in debugging mode. Once
debugging a function, you can hit <Enter> to evaluate the current line,
`go(n)` to go to line `n` in the function and `qqq()` to quit the function
(See debug's help for details). A useful tip is to click on the title bar of
the debug window and choose "Always on top" or a similar option provided by
your desktop manager.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							    *Nvim-R-latex-box*
9.16. Integration with LaTeX-Box~

LaTeX-Box does not automatically recognize Rnoweb files as a valid LaTeX file.
You have to tell LaTeX-Box that the .tex file compiled by either `knitr()` or
`Sweave()` is the main LaTeX file. You can do this in two ways. Suppose that
your Rnoweb file is called report.Rnw... You can:

   (1) Create an empty file called "report.tex.latexmain".

   or

   (2) Put in the first 5 lines of report.Rnw:
>
   % For LaTeX-Box: root = report.tex
<
   or

   (3) If you do not use child rnoweb documents, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   autocmd FileType rnoweb let b:main_tex_file = substitute(expand("%"), "\....$", ".tex", "")
<
Of course you must run either `knitr()` or `Sweave()` before trying LaTeX-Box
omnicompletion. Please, read LaTeX-Box documentation for more information.


See also: |R_latexcmd|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							  *Nvim-R-quick-setup*
9.17. Suggested setup for Nvim-R~

Please, look at section |Nvim-R-options| if you want information about the
Nvim-R customization.

Here are some suggestions of configuration for Vim/Neovim. To understand what
you are doing, and change the configuration to your taste, please read this
document from the beginning.

   ~/.vimrc or ~/.config/nvim/init.vim or ~\AppData\Local\nvim\init.vim~
>
   " Change Leader and LocalLeader keys:
   let maplocalleader = ','
   let mapleader = ';'

   " Use Ctrl+Space to do omnicompletion:
   if has('nvim') || has('gui_running')
       inoremap <C-Space> <C-x><C-o>
   else
       inoremap <Nul> <C-x><C-o>
   endif

   " Press the space bar to send lines and selection to R:
   vmap <Space> <Plug>RDSendSelection
   nmap <Space> <Plug>RDSendLine
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								 *rout_colors*
9.18. Syntax highlight of .Rout files~

You can set the both foreground background colors of R output in your |vimrc|.
The example below is for either a gui version of Vim or a terminal
interface of Neovim with 'termguicolors' (see |true-color|):
>
   if has('gui_running') || &termguicolors
     let rout_color_input    = 'guifg=#9e9e9e'
     let rout_color_normal   = 'guifg=#ff5f00'
     let rout_color_number   = 'guifg=#ffaf00'
     let rout_color_integer  = 'guifg=#feaf00'
     let rout_color_float    = 'guifg=#fdaf00'
     let rout_color_complex  = 'guifg=#fcaf00'
     let rout_color_negnum   = 'guifg=#d7afff'
     let rout_color_negfloat = 'guifg=#d6afff'
     let rout_color_date     = 'guifg=#00d7af'
     let rout_color_true     = 'guifg=#5dd685'
     let rout_color_false    = 'guifg=#ff5d5e'
     let rout_color_inf      = 'guifg=#10aed7'
     let rout_color_constant = 'guifg=#5fafcf'
     let rout_color_string   = 'guifg=#5fd7af'
     let rout_color_error    = 'guifg=#ffffff guibg=#c40000'
     let rout_color_warn     = 'guifg=#d00000'
     let rout_color_index    = 'guifg=#d0d080'
   endif
<
If you are running Vim with support for 256 colors, you could use lines like
these:
>
   if &t_Co == 256
     let rout_color_input    = 'ctermfg=247'
     let rout_color_normal   = 'ctermfg=39'
     " etc.
   endif
<
You can also set both true colors and 256 colors at the same time:
>
   let rout_color_input    = 'ctermfg=247 guifg=#9e9e9e'
   let rout_color_normal   = 'ctermfg=39 guifg=#ff5f00'
   " etc.
<
To know what number corresponds to your preferred color (among the 256
possibilities), hover you mouse pointer over the table of colors built by:
>
   library("colorout")
   show256Colors()
<
If you prefer that R output is highlighted using you current |:colorscheme|,
put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let rout_follow_colorscheme = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							       *Nvim-R-global*
9.19 Enable the plugin when editing any file type~

Nvim-R is a file-type plugin. This means that its functionalities will be
available only when an R file type is being edited (R, Rnoweb, Rhelp, Rmd,
etc). However, if you need to run R with other file types, you can put in your
|vimrc|:
>
   command RStart let oldft=&ft | set ft=r | exe 'set ft='.oldft | let b:IsInRCode = function("DefaultIsInRCode") | normal <LocalLeader>rf
<
The above Vim line will create the Normal mode command `:RStart` which when
run will:

  1. Set the file-type of the buffer being edited as "r" and, consequently,
     enable Nvim-R.

  2. Set the file-type back to its original value.

  3. Avoid an internal error when you type "_".

  4. Start R.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							  *Nvim-R-reload-html*
9.20 Auto refresh HTML page~

Nvim-R gets the value of R's "browser" option (as returned by
`getOption("browser")` to open an HTML document. The problem is that most
browsers always open a new tab instead of refreshing a tab where the document
is already open. One solution for this issue is to create a script to refresh
the tab and set the value of the `browser` option to this script. For example,
on Linux, if you create the script at `~/bin/reload_html` and make it
executable, and if the `~/bin` directory is in your PATH, you could put in
your `~/.Rprofile`:
>
   options(browser = "reload_html")
<
The contents of `reload_html` could be:
>
   #!/bin/sh

   # Get the document title because Firefox use it in the window name
   WINNAME=`grep '<title>.*</title>' "$1" | sed -e 's/.*<title>\(.*\)<\/title>.*/\1/'`

   # If the title is empty, use the file name
   if [ "x$WINNAME" = "x" ]
   then
       WINNAME=$1
   fi

   # Check if the page is already open
   xdotool search --name "$WINNAME" windowactivate --sync

   if [ "$?" = "0" ]
   then
       # The page is open; emulate the F5 key press to refresh it:
       xdotool search --name "$WINNAME" key --clearmodifiers F5
   else
       # Start the browser
       firefox "$1" &
   fi
<
The above script requires that `xdotool` is installed, and it works with
Firefox. If you prefer Google-Chrome, just replace `firefox` with
`google-chrome`. Other browsers might require further adjustments. The script
will not work on Mac OS X because both Firefox and Google-Chrome run on the
native OS X environment, and the `xdotool` application can manipulate only
applications running on the X Server.

For examples of Mac OS X scripts, please, see:

   https://gist.github.com/itissid/0725fc55ae837dcb0b40ce1b65511d50

and

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							       *Nvim-R-remote*
9.21 Remote access~

The easiest way of running R in a remote machine is logging into the remote
machine through ssh, starting Neovim and running R in a Neovim's terminal (the
default). You will only need both Vim (or Neovim) and R configured as usual in
the remote machine.

However, if you need to start either Neovim or Vim in the local machine and
run R in the remote machine, then, a lot of additional configuration is
required to enable full communication between Vim and R because by default
both Nvim-R and nvimcom only accept TCP connections from the local host, and,
R saves temporary files in the `/tmp` directory of the machine where it is
running. To make the communication between local Vim and remote R possible,
each application have to know the IP addres of the other, and some remote
directories must be mounted locally. Here is an example of how to achieve this
goal (tested on April, 2017).

   1. Setup the remote machine to accept ssh login from the local machine
      without password (search the Internet to discover how to do it).

   2. At the remote machine:

      - You have to edit your `~/.Rprofile` to create the environment variable
	`R_IP_ADDRESS`. R will save this value in a file that Vim has to read
	to be able to send messages to R. If the remote machine is a Linux
	system, the following code might work:
>
	# Only create the environment variable R_IP_ADDRESS if NVIM_IP_ADDRESS
	# exists, that is, if R is being controlled remotely:
        if(interactive() && Sys.getenv("NVIM_IP_ADDRESS") != ""){
            Sys.setenv("R_IP_ADDRESS" = trimws(system("hostname -I", intern = TRUE)))
        }
<
	If the code above does not work, you have to find a way of discovering
	the IP address of the remote machine (perhaps parsing the output of
	`ifconfig`).

   3. At the local machine:

      - Make the directories `~/.remoteR/NvimR_cache` and `~/.remoteR/R_library`.

      - Create the shell script `~/bin/mountR` with the following contents,
	and make it executable (of course, replace `remotelogin`, `remotehost`
	and the path to R library with valid values for your case):
>
       #!/bin/sh
       sshfs remotelogin@remotehost:/home/remotelogin/.cache/Nvim-R ~/.remoteR/NvimR_cache
       sshfs remotelogin@remotehost:/home/remotelogin/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.3 ~/.remoteR/R_library
<
      - Create the shell script `~/bin/sshR` with the following contents, and
	make it executable (replace `remotelogin` and `remotehost` with the
	real values):
>
        #!/bin/sh
        ssh -t remotelogin@remotehost "PATH=/home/remotelogin/bin:\$PATH \

      - Add the following lines to your |vimrc| (replace `hostname -I` with a
	command that works in your system):
>
	" Setup Vim to use the remote R only if the output of df includes
	" the string 'remoteR', that is, the remote file system is mounted:

9.22 Create custom mappings for viewing data.frames or matrices~

Using the method described in |Nvim-R-key-bindings|, you can customize how
data.frames or matrices are viewed by passing a string of optional arguments
to `RAction`, starting with a comma. The accepted arguments are:

   - `location` which should be a string like `"vsplit"` or `"above 10split"`,
     and determines where the data is opened (see |opening-window|).

   - `nrows` which is the number of rows of the data to open.

Examples:
>
   nmap <silent> <LocalLeader>vl :call RAction("viewdf", ", location='aboveleft vsp'")<CR>
   nmap <silent> <LocalLeader>vt :call RAction("viewdf", ", location='topleft 11sp', nrows=10")<CR>
